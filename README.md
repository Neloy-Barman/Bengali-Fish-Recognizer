# Bengali-Fish-Recognizer
## Problem Statement
A bengali fish image recognizer that can classify in between: - 
1. Ayre <br/>
2. Catla <br/>
3. Chital <br/>
4. Ilish <br/>
5. Kachki <br/>
6. Kajoli <br/>
7. Koi <br/>
8. Magur <br/>
9. Mola Dhela <br/>
10. Mrigal <br/>
11. Pabda <br/>
12. Pangash <br/>
13. Poa <br/>
14. Puti <br/>
15. Rui <br/>
16. Shing <br/>
17. Silver Carp <br/>
18. Taki <br/>
19. Telapia <br/>
20. Tengra
## Objective
There are many kinds of fishes sold in Bangladeshi fish markets. Each of them has their own characteristics. <br/>
But there are a few that sometimes look alike but can be differentiated using tiny details. Such as, A Catla fish's head size is larger than the Rui's but other features are almost same.<br/>
Ayre and Pangash both have same body structure but an ayre fish has hackeles whereas pangash doesn't fall in catfish category. There are many fishes like that.<br/>
The main goal of this recognizer project is to categorize in between them.
